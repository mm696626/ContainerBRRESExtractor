# ContainerBRRESExtractor

### Container BRRES Extractor
* A tool to extract container format BRRESS files since they don't extract directly in BrawlCrate
    * Learn more about the format here: https://wiki.vg-resource.com/BRRES

### Setup to get this tool working
* Have a container file from a Wii game with models/textures/other
* Open the tool (you'll need the latest JDK installed for that)
    * Link to JDK: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
* Browse for the file and subfolder and press Extract
* Please be patient when your folder is being extracted. It'll look like nothing is happening, but wait for the confirmation that it's done
* Open your newly extracted files in BrawlCrate!

### Games that I Know Work with This
* Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo
* Sin and Punishment: Star Successor
* Kamen Rider Climax Heroes W
* Pac-Man Party
